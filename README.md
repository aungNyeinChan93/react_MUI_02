# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules for code quality.

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast development with Vite's lightning-fast bundling and HMR
- üõ† Minimal configuration to get started quickly
- üßπ Basic ESLint setup for code consistency

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for integrating React with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh and JSX transformation.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for even faster Fast Refresh and JSX transformation.

You can choose either plugin based on your project's needs and performance requirements.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run json
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. This helps catch more errors at compile time and improves code maintainability.

- Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
- You can further customize your ESLint configuration by extending from popular configs like `eslint:recommended`, `plugin:react/recommended`, and `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`.
